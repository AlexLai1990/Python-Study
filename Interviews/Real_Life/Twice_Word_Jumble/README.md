##Word Jumble for Twice

Hi Twice!

Thank you for your time and consideration. Here's my [result](./word_jumble.py).

The dictionary you recommended has so many single chars, making my result looks not as good as expected. But anyway, they are in the dict.

So I use ```sh``` library to do a ```grep``` search.

You may need to do a ```sudo pip install sh``` if you don't have that package.

That's it.

Feel free to take a look at other repositories I have. They are all written by me.

Also, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:yc859@cornell.edu) if you have any question.

Thank you!
